It provides the backend layer responsible for defining a GraphQL schema and resolving client requests against underlying data sources.

### What Apollo Server Helps With

Apollo Server focuses on the **server-side GraphQL API**, including:

- Exposing a GraphQL endpoint
- Defining the schema that describes available data and operations
- Implementing resolvers that fetch or compute requested fields
- Integrating with databases, REST APIs, and other backend services
- Structuring a GraphQL API in a scalable and maintainable way
