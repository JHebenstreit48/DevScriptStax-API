## GraphQL Schema

---

### Overview

The schema defines what data can be requested and what operations are available.

It acts as a contract between client and server.

### Directives (Concept)

Directives are annotations that can influence schema behavior or execution rules.

They are commonly used to describe constraints or behavior that tools and servers can interpret.
