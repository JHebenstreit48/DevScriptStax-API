## GraphQL Subscriptions

---

### Overview

Subscriptions are used for real-time updates.

Instead of a single request and response, subscriptions keep a connection open so the server can push updates when events occur.

### Common Use Cases

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

🔹 Chat messages and live feeds  
🔹 Notifications  
🔹 Real-time dashboards  
🔹 Collaboration updates  

</div>

### Notes

Subscriptions are a GraphQL feature.

The transport mechanism (such as WebSockets or SSE) depends on the server/client implementation and is usually documented in tool-specific sections.
