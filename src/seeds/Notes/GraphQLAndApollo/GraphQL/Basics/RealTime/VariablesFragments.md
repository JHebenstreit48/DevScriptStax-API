## Variables and Fragments

---

### Overview

Variables and fragments are common features used to make GraphQL operations more reusable and maintainable.

---

### Variables (Concept)

Variables allow dynamic input values to be passed into operations.

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

🔹 Avoid string-building operations manually  
🔹 Improve reuse of operation documents  
🔹 Separate operation structure from runtime values  

</div>

---

### Fragments (Concept)

Fragments let you reuse common field selections across operations.

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

🔹 Reduce repetition in operation documents  
🔹 Keep field selections consistent  
🔹 Make large operations easier to maintain  

</div>
