## GraphQL Mutations

---

### Overview

Mutations are used to modify data on the server.

This includes creating, updating, or deleting records.

---

### Core Idea

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

🔹 Mutations perform writes (create, update, delete)  
🔹 The client still selects what fields to return  
🔹 The server controls how data changes occur  

</div>

---

### Notes

Mutations are a GraphQL concept.

Client libraries may provide helpers for updating UI or refetching queries, but those helpers are tool-specific.
