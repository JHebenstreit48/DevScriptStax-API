## GraphQL Queries

---

### Overview

Queries are used to request data from a GraphQL server.

A query describes the shape of the response the client wants.

### Core Idea

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

🔹 Queries fetch data (read-only operations)  
🔹 The client selects fields to include in the response  
🔹 Nested fields allow requesting related data together  

</div>
