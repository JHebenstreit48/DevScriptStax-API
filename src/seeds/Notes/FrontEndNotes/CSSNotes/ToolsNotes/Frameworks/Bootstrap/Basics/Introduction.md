### When NOT to Use Bootstrap
- If your project requires highly customized styles, Bootstrap may introduce unwanted extra styles.
- For small-scale websites, writing custom CSS might be simpler and more efficient.
- If you need maximum performance, a lightweight CSS framework or utility-first approach (like Tailwind CSS) may be better.

### Adding Bootstrap to Your Project
To use Bootstrap, you need to include its CSS and JavaScript files.

#### 1. Go to Bootstrapâ€™s official website  
ðŸ“Œ [https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com)  

#### 2. Copy the Bootstrap CDN links  
On the main page, find the CDN (Content Delivery Network) links.

#### 3. Paste them inside your HTML file  
Add these links inside the head for CSS, and before the closing body tag for JavaScript.

```html  
<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->  
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">  

<!-- Bootstrap JavaScript -->  
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>  
```

Now Bootstrap is ready to use! ðŸš€
