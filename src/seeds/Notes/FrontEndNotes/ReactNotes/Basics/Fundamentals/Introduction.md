# React Basics

## Introduction

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces by composing reusable components. These allow developers to define a UI component once and render it with different data across the app.

### 🧰 Why React Matters

- Designed for building slick, dynamic interfaces.
- Components encourage flexibility and reusability.
- Seamlessly updates parts of the UI without full page refreshes.

## 📜 History of React

React was born out of a need to efficiently update UI elements without reloading entire pages. In **2010**, Jordan Walke, a developer at Facebook, created a prototype called FaxJS to solve this problem internally.

By **2011**, it was powering Facebook's News Feed and soon became part of Instagram’s infrastructure as well.

In **May 2013**, Facebook officially released React as an open-source project at JSConf US. It quickly gained traction thanks to its simplicity, efficiency, and component-based design.

In **2015**, Facebook expanded React’s influence by launching React Native, a framework for building mobile apps using the same React principles.

In **2017**, React underwent a core rewrite known as the "Fiber" architecture. This upgrade improved performance and laid the foundation for powerful new features like concurrent rendering.

And in **2019**, React introduced Hooks—such as <span class="codeSnip">useState</span> and <span class="codeSnip">useEffect</span>—allowing developers to manage component logic in a more reusable and functional style, all without writing class components.

## Core Concepts (Overview)

- ✅ Components: self-contained UI building blocks.
- ✅ Reusability: define once, render multiple times.
- ✅ Virtual DOM: updates only changed UI pieces.
- ✅ JSX syntax: template-style JavaScript markup.
- ✅ Unidirectional data flow: props passed from parent to child.

## Summary

- React originated from Facebook’s internal tooling around **2010–2011**.
- Public release: **2013**, followed by React Native (**2015**), Fiber (**2017**), and Hooks (**2019**).
- Its design goal: efficient, component-based UI updates.
- React remains one of the most influential tools in modern web development.
