## What is HTML?
---

<span class="emphasis">Hypertext Markup Language</span> <span class="secondEmphasis">(HTML)</span> is one of the cornerstone <span class="emphasis">languages</span> of the web.

## Structure of HTML

<span class="emphasis">HTML</span> defines the <span class="emphasis">structure</span> of a webpage, similar to how a skeleton provides support for the human body.

HTML is composed of <span class="emphasis">elements</span>, which define the <span class="emphasis">content</span> and framework of a webpage.

### Examples of Common Elements:

<div class="bullet2">

- Text

- Links

</div>

## DOCTYPE Declaration

The <span class="emphasis">&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</span> declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It must be the first line of an HTML document for proper browser rendering.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

## HTML Element

The <span class="emphasis">&lt;html&gt;</span> element serves as the root of an HTML document. All other elements must be contained within this tag.

```html
<html>
  ...
</html>
```
