## Creating & Running an Angular Application
---

### 1. Install Angular CLI

Angular CLI is the official command-line tool for creating and managing Angular projects.

```shell
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

💡 **Tip:** After installation, verify the CLI version by running:

```shell
ng version
```

If installed correctly, this will display the Angular CLI version, Node.js version, and other relevant environment details.

---

### 2. Generate a New Angular Project
Create a new Angular project by running:

```shell
ng new my-angular-app
```

Follow the CLI prompts to configure the project options:

```shell
CLI Prompts (Interactive)
-------------------------------------------
? Would you like to add Angular routing? (y/N) → Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? (CSS, SCSS, LESS, Stylus) → SCSS
-------------------------------------------
```
🔹 **Additional CLI Flags:**
- To skip routing:

```shell
ng new my-angular-app --skip-routing
```

- To set a specific styling format:

```shell
ng new my-angular-app --style=scss
```

---

### 3. Navigate to the Project Folder
Once the project is created, move into your project directory:

```shell
cd my-angular-app
```

---

### 4. Serve the Application
Run the development server with:

```shell
ng serve
```

By default, this starts a local development server and automatically recompiles changes.

```shell
# ✔ Compiled successfully.
# Angular Live Development Server is running on http://localhost:4200/

# 📌 **Access the application in a web browser at:**
# 🌐 http://localhost:4200
```

---

### 5. Customizing the Development Server
🔹 **Run the server on a different port (default is 4200):**

```shell
ng serve --port 4500
```

🔹 **Enable Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for faster live updates:**

```shell
ng serve --hmr
```

---

### 6. Understanding Development vs. Production Mode
By default, ng serve runs in **development mode**, which includes debugging tools and source maps.

To create an optimized **production build**, use:

```shell
ng build --prod
```

This generates a **minified, tree-shaken dist/ folder** ready for deployment.
