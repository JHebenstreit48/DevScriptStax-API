# HTML History

## First Code

The first iteration of HTML was written in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee.

HTML has been revised so many times since then and has resulted in several different versions of it over the years.

<div class="xrefNav">
  <div class="xrefItem">
    <a class="xrefBtn" href="/html/basics/fundamentals/introduction">← Back</a>
    <div class="xrefTitle">HTML Fundamentals → Introduction</div>
  </div>

  <div class="xrefItem">
    <a class="xrefBtn" href="/html/basics/structure/elements">Next →</a>
    <div class="xrefTitle">Topic: HTML Structure → Elements/Tags</div>
  </div>
</div>
