## Introduction to Bootstrap
---

### What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a **CSS and JavaScript framework** designed to make web development **faster and easier**. It provides **pre-written styles, responsive layouts, and UI components**, allowing developers to build professional-looking websites with minimal effort.

---

### Why Use Bootstrap?
✅ Pre-styled Components → Includes buttons, modals, forms, and more.
✅ Responsive Design → Adapts to all screen sizes automatically.
✅ Grid System → Helps create structured layouts easily.
✅ CSS & JavaScript Utilities → Predefined spacing, colors, and typography.
✅ Industry Standard → Used by millions of developers worldwide.
✅ CDN Available → No need for installation; just include a link.

### When NOT to Use Bootstrap
- If your project requires highly customized styles, Bootstrap may introduce unwanted extra styles.
- For small-scale websites, writing custom CSS might be simpler and more efficient.
- If you need maximum performance, a lightweight CSS framework or utility-first approach (like Tailwind CSS) may be better.

### Adding Bootstrap to Your Project
To use Bootstrap, you need to include its CSS and JavaScript files.

#### 1. Go to Bootstrap’s official website
📌 [https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com)

#### 2. Copy the Bootstrap CDN links
On the main page, find the CDN (Content Delivery Network) links.

#### 3. Paste them inside your HTML file
Add these links inside the head for CSS, and before the closing body tag for JavaScript.

```html
<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Bootstrap JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```
