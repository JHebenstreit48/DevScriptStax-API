# Seeding & Local Dev

---
### What Seeding Means
---

Seeding is the process of inserting starter/test data into a database so you can develop and test features without manually creating documents every time.

---
### Running a Seed Script
---

Run your project’s seed script (if defined in package.json):

```shell
npm run seed
```

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

🔹 Useful for local development and testing  
🔹 Common after wiping/resetting your database  
🔹 Depends on your project having a seed script set up  

</div>
