# Update Operations
---

Update operations modify existing documents in a collection.

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

🔹 Change one or more fields  
🔹 Leave unspecified fields untouched  
🔹 Target documents using filter criteria  

</div>

### Conceptual Behavior
---

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

🔹 Updates apply to existing documents only  
🔹 You do not need to resubmit the entire document  
🔹 Multiple documents can be updated at once  

</div>

Update operations are conceptually similar to REST <span class="emphasis">PUT</span> or <span class="emphasis">PATCH</span> requests.
