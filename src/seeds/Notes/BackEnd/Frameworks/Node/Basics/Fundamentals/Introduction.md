# Introduction


---
### Overview
---

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a browser, enabling server-side scripting for scalable applications such as APIs, real-time services, and command-line tools.

---
### Key Features
---

- **Non-blocking I/O:** Node.js uses asynchronous, event-driven programming to handle input/output operations efficiently, making it ideal for high-performance, scalable applications.
- **Single-threaded with Event Loop:** While Node.js operates on a single thread, it uses an event loop to manage concurrency. Modern versions also support worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks.
- **npm (Node Package Manager):** Comes with a vast library of reusable packages, simplifying development and dependency management.
- **Cross-platform:** Runs on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
